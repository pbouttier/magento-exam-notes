# Explain class naming conventions and their relationship with the autoloader

## 1. Overview

As previously mentioned the autoloader can be found under the "lib/Varien" directory.

A class is loaded as follows:

## 2. Sets the include paths



## 2. Autoloading

Dans *app/Mage.php* these 3 paths are loaded using *set_include_path* using a trick
of imploding the array of paths with a double colon and passing it as the parameter for this function.

**Note:** the *lib* directory is also added the at the end of the array of paths. The *lib* directory contains core libraries for Magento such as the Zend Framework.

This will include the 3 codepool paths instead of 1. When the autoloader is searching for a file it will look in these 3 sub-directories for the file in order listed above.

If you wanted to add your own codepool you would add a path to *$paths* array.

The autoloader class is *Varien_Autoload* and can be found in the *lib/Varien* directory.

As explained previously there are 4 include paths loaded with the *set_include_path* function in *app/Mage.php*.

The *lib/Varien/Autoload.php* file is included once so the class *Varien_Autoload* can be called.


## 3. Autoloader


The *autoload* method of the class is registered with *spl_autoload_register* function.

This method then does the following when autoloading a class:

- Replaces any underscore with a space
- Uppercases the filename using *ucwords*
- Replaces the space with the *DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR*
- Appends .php to the end of the file


So for instance the class *Mage_Catalog_Model_Product* filename would autoload the file  *Mage/Catalog/Model/Product.php*.

As the includes are set, PHP would search in all 3 codepools for this file so eventually it would find the file under *app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Product.php*.
